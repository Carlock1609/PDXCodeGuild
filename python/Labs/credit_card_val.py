# DIFFERENT SOLUTION!! WHY IS IT NOT WORKING

# Convert the input string into a list of ints
# Slice off the last digit. That is the check digit.
# Reverse the digits.
# Double every other element in the reversed list.
# Subtract nine from numbers over nine.
# Sum all values.
# Take the second digit of that sum.
# If that matches the check digit, the whole card number is valid.

# How do i split everything into different functions but i need the same digit list
