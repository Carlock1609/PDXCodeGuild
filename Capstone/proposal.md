# Capstone Project

## Name: AchieveSTATUS.com

## Project Overview

### Discription:
- This is an application to bring Photographers and Influencers into one social media application. 
The purpose of the application is to make it easier for Influencers and Photographers to gain experience,
instead of recieving random DM's from people--Everyone in this application is here for the same reason, to Achieve STATUS.

- Photographers can filter through a list of influencers by their follower count, and Influencers
can filter through a list of Photographers based on their past collaborations, portfolios and social media pages.
Once either is found, the user can message directly for connections or collaborations.

## Functionality

### Influencer:
- User must have an account and are required to link their social media accounts to get their follower counts.
- User will have the follower count for each application on feed/profile, and total folower count combined aswell.
- The Influencer has the choice of collaborating with anyone.

### Photographer:
- User will upload portfolio/experience and other collaborations to feed/profile.
- User can set filter on search to get a list that meets the preffered follower count criteria.
- User will send message to Influencer to collaborate and of course the Influencer has the choice to deny.

### Function Ideas:
- Photographers get more(rank system/probono) for working with influencers with lower follower counts or new influencers.
Rank system to help new Influencers/Photographers to get started out. A pro bono system to intice people to help
other Photographers/Influencers Achieve STATUS. PRO BONO IDEA, the higher the rank the more your posts and portfolio will show on the main feed.
- Photo Location marker - When photos are used, a suggestion comes up to share location so it will be plotted on a map, 
so other Users can find cool spots to take pictures.
- Chat system - Users can connect with eachother to get connections to help find local connections or to meetup.
- ALL DATA STORED IN DB
