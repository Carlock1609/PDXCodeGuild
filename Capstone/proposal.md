# **Capstone Project**

## **Name:** AchieveSTATUS.com

#
## **Project Overview**

### Discription:
- This is an application to bring Photographers and Influencers into one social media application. The purpose of this application is to make it easier for Influencers and Photographers to connect, gain experience and build both portfolios. Instead of having to go through private messages, random DM's, and business queries that could be about anything--Everyone in this application is here for the same reason, an easier way to connect and to Achieve STATUS.

- Photographers can filter through a list of influencers by their follower count, and Influencers can filter through a list of Photographers based on their past portfolios, collaborations and linked pages. Once one is found, the user can message directly for connections or to collaborate.

- The idea for this application is to help new Photographers and Influencers get their start, by inticing them to work with newer users rather than collaborating with users who have already made it.

    ### Libraries/Frameworks

    - BeautifulSoup4 - Will be used to scrape linked social media account for follower counts.
    - Django - will be used for web framework.
    - Leaflet, MapBoxing - Will be used to plot out local spots perfect for taking photos.
    - Bootstrap4 - This will be pretty heavy in frontend.
